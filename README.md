Project Overview
This project builds and trains a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from images. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains thousands of labeled images of digits. The project demonstrates the basics of deep learning, including data normalization, model creation, training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions.

Dataset
Name: MNIST Handwritten Digit Database

Description: 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (60,000 for training, 10,000 for testing)

Image Size: 28x28 pixels

Labels: 0–9

The dataset is automatically downloaded by TensorFlow/Keras when you run the code.

Requirements

Python 3.7 or higher
TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib

Install all dependencies using:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-digit-classifier.git
cd handwritten-digit-classifier

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the model:
python3 model.py


What happens next:

The script will train the model on the MNIST dataset.

After training, it will evaluate the model on the test data and print the test accuracy.

It will display a sample test image with the predicted and actual labels.

Model Architecture
Input Layer: Flattens 28x28 images into a 784-length vector.

Hidden Layer: Dense layer with 128 neurons, ReLU activation.

Output Layer: Dense layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit), softmax activation.

Results
Expected Accuracy: ~98% on the test set after 5 epochs (may vary by hardware).

Visualization: The script displays a test image with its predicted and actual label.
